# Coding Challenges
Welcome to the Coding Challenges Repository! This repository serves as a collection of projects aimed at learning new concepts and improving problem-solving skills using the Go programming language.

## Projects
**1. Rate Limiter**
The Rate Limiter project implements various rate limiting algorithms, including token bucket, fixed window counter, and sliding window counter. It also features integration with Redis for distributed rate limiting across multiple servers.

**2. JSON Parser**
The JSON Parser project is a simple yet efficient tool written in Go for parsing JSON data. It supports parsing nested objects and arrays, as well as different data types such as strings, numbers, booleans, and null values.

**3. Word Count (wc)**
The Word Count (wc) project is a command-line tool implemented in Go for counting the number of words, lines, and characters in a given text file. It demonstrates basic file I/O operations and string manipulation techniques in Go.

**4. Algorithms**
This project contains code exploring the implementation of different algorithms not specific to any particular area.

## How to Use
Each project directory contains its own README file with specific instructions on how to build, run, and test the project. Follow the instructions provided in each project's README to understand the project's functionality and usage.

## Contribution Guidelines
Contributions to the projects in this repository are welcome! If you have ideas for new projects, improvements to existing projects, or bug fixes, feel free to submit pull requests. Please ensure that your contributions adhere to the project's coding standards and follow best practices in Go development.
